- You will need to select a report date before you begin this process.

You can select any report date of your choosing. This differs from aggregate data entry, in which you select a predefined period. For events, any report date can be selected.

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MYeKPu40b6vo9M4kS2MDBZ6YI8vZ5HOwfgghvHLyFP46IOcoG9FsddJ6JK0A4fOgJuTs0V1IDgbEhK_Zcx6UhXlcHX7lU0FOMqEXmWpPApMCQgYAcZULb3fDodz4Ddb4VvqGKyAD" width="624" height="237" />

After selecting the report date, the questions within the program will appear. Note that you only see two questions as the remainder are hidden by the logic associated with the survey (or, in DHIS 2 terms. the program rules).

- Fill in the following data.

Note that program rules should be triggered when you select the following questions:

Does this facility offer family planning services?

- Triggers the follow-up questions related to family planning services

Received any family planning training in the last two years?

## Session Quiz - Introdiction to Tracker

### NOTE: THIS IS A GRADED QUIZ

You are allowed 3 attempts for this quiz.

There is 30 seconds of time between each attempt, so if you don't get it right, just breathe in, watch the videos once more and carefully read the question again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tracker is meant to: (select one)
( ) Replace existing electronic medical records (EMR)
(x) Bridge the gap between the existing aggregated data and individual-level (tracker) or anonymous event based data
( ) Only be used for tracking patients receiving health services

[Explanation]
Tracker programs can be used outside of the health system, and are not meant to necessarily replace an EMR. This was discussed in the tracker intro presentation.
[Explanation]

What is one of the key differences between event and tracker programs? (select one)
(x) In tracker programs details are registered in order to follow an entity. Event programs do not include this registration
( ) In event programs details are registered in order to follow an entity. Tracker programs do not include this registration
( ) Event programs are more a more advanced version of collection individual data when compared to tracker programs

[Explanation]
Tracker programs involve a key component of registration whereas event programs are anonymous in nature. This was discussed in the tracker intro presentation.
[Explanation]

In event capture we can:
[x] Add in validation rules/warnings
[x] Add in indicators that calculate on-the-fly
[x] Enter data offline

[Explanation]

[Explanation]

When we enter data in event/tracker capture, we must choose a pre-defined period such as weekly, monthly, etc. before entering data.
( ) True
(x) False

[Explanation]
All of these functions work in event capture. This was demoed during the event capture session.
[Explanation]

Which of the following statement(s) regarding tracker are NOT true: (select one or more)
[x] Tracker and event data cannot be aggregated
[x] Tracker and event data cannot be compared with aggregated data together
[ ] Tracker and event capture can be audited to see what changes have been made to the data

[Explanation]
Tracker and event data can be aggregated and analyzed in the analysis apps. They can also be analyzed together with routine aggregate date. This was shown during the event analysis session.
[Explanation]

An entity (person, etc.) can only be registered in one tracker program at a time
( ) True
(x) False

[Explanation]
A person can be registered in multiple tracker programs if required.
[Explanation]

In tracker capture, we can add in relationships, such as mother-child, brother-sister, etc.
(x) True
( ) False

[Explanation]
Relationships between various entities can be added using tracker capture.
[Explanation]

In event capture, if someone comes back to the clinic with malaria more than once I can easily find their record again in DHIS2
( ) True
(x) False

[Explanation]
Event programs are isolated events. As there is no registration component, it would be very difficult to link these events as you would manually have to find the last time they received treatment.
[Explanation]

We can analyze combined indicators that use any combination of data from event, tracker or routine aggregated data entry
(x) True
( ) False

[Explanation]
We can use combined indicators to combine any of the data types used within DHIS2. This was shown during the event analysis session.
[Explanation]
