You can move the items around and resize them to your liking in order to get a feel for how the objects on the dashboard work. This is a very useful tool for bringing together multiple analysis in a particular thematic area together in order to be reviewed quickly. It is particular useful for program managers to receive at-a-glance information regarding the programs they are responsible for.

## Session Quiz - Integrated Analysis, Dashbiards, Messaging and Sharing

### NOTE: THIS IS A GRADED QUIZ

You are allowed 3 attempts for this quiz.

There is 30 seconds of time between each attempt, so if you don't get it right, just breathe in, watch the videos once more and carefully read the question again.

I have created a pivot table with the following dimensions:

- Data Element Group: Delivery
- Data Element: Births, Live
- Period: Last 4 Quarters
- Organisation Units: Trainingland Districts

In a real-life setting, a username will likely not be used to identify a favorite.

>>Which of the following is a good name for the favorite? (select one)<<
( ) Live Births
( ) Deliveries in Trainingland, last 4 Quarters
( ) Live Births by Trainingland Districts, last 4 Quarters
(x) Delivery_Live Births, Districts, last 4 Quarters

[Explanation]
The naming convention for favorites should include your the program name and the 3 core dimensions (what you are measuring, where it is coming from and when it is coming from). This option includes all of these aspects.
[Explanation]

>>I want to do some analysis comparing all of the following:<<

- All Facilities within my organisation unit hierarchy

## 3.6  - Reports App and Reporting Rates

### Activity 1 - Data Set Reports and Resources

In [TRAININGLAND](https://live.academy.dhis2.org/tl1/dhis-web-commons/security/login.action), please run a data set report. In order to access data set reports:

-Go to Apps -&gt; Reports -&gt; Data Set Report

<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lZJ88-XGPNotg8Vf7bp-MjwBKr8-qqgyFf_Z2egaDAX5EaIlbDVmfN6sS-dcRSZ5GVaXKgP3MpgqN8uilwqiA0IvbOoYtbkx54GevnsX51PUCgj2KAkpO3CRyETRB9IlWRNQrIQy" width="624" height="99" />

Select the criteria for the data set report and click on "Get report" when ready. You can use the following as a guide:

-Data Set: Primary Health Care Monthly
-Period Type: Yearly
-Period: 2016
-Organisation Unit: Animal Region (you can try any org unit you like here)

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Lu6OBb8KxS1AmrhgHfNDKn6WB_JJhmsrNVw9YWEY4DypWJUa-VRV0BRevdZyTa1CU2K5Zl1aXWXMFmQfqs8pxlGpHIZ6mu5_DSDOfy3Ie6znnkP2ACBPyCW_yWwpbyVpDnrmFJ_f" width="368" height="456" />

-You will see the results for the dataset/period/organisation unit combination after you click on "Get report".

As discussed in the video, this gives you a layout of the data set as you would see it in data entry. You can not edit the data here however, and this can often serve as an ideal location to review the data in a format that users are familiar with. The data can be aggregated within this report, and therefore looked at within different levels of the hierarchy as required.

<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/AEy5YFzbbyn2f_CNtUAFDsZKgRgHorMUkxycjZt7DOgNB8MSPuZxhzmlC4mtYOOqBgZ7x0w51ekgaraibtL8jI3FYsmaZ3YYyGNl7JyIhGcmofu5MYRwtPAMdzrPbNneBZ3kWFz_" width="557" height="585" />
