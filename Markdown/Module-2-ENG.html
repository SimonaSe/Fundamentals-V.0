<p>Mini Quiz (not graded) - Introduction to DHIS2/History</p>

<p>====</p>

<p>>>DHIS 2 can be used as a &lsquo;data warehouse&rsquo; to store data from multiple data sources in one location<< <br>
(x) True<br>
( ) False</p>

<p>[explanation]<br>
DHIS 2 can combine data from multiple data sources. This includes through routine data that is directly collected within the system you are working as well as supplementary data from other sources such as surveys. <br>
[explanation]</p>

<p>>>The HISP network works collaboratively on advancing the features which DHIS 2 supports<< <br>
(x) True<br>
( ) False</p>

<p>[explanation]<br>
The HISP network is a world-wide collaboration that supports the development of the DHIS 2 project. Collaboration between the nodes is a key area of interest to ensure that DHIS 2 continues to meet local needs as defined by its users. <br>

<p>Mini Quiz (no graded) - Introduction to Trainingland</p>

<p>====</p>

<p>>>Trainingland has been created to demonstrate: (select one or more)<< <br>
[x] Data collection forms<br>
[x] Data Analysis<br>
[x] Indicators</p>

<p>[explanation]<br>
Trainingland is part of the training environment that has been created in order for users to learn how DHIS 2 is structured and how information can be collected and reviewed. It uses modeled data that allows users to learn some of the fundamentals of DHIS 2 functionality. <br>
[explanation]</p>

<script>
	function requestAccount() {
		var baseUrl = window.location.href.split("/", 3).join("/");
		$.ajax({
			url: baseUrl + "/api/user/v1/accounts",
			dataType: "json",
			success: function(data) {
				var email = data[0].email;
				var obj = {"email": email, "type": "default"};
				console.log(obj)

<p>Mini Quiz (not graded) - The 1000 MVD's Use Case</p>

<p>====</p>

<p>>>The 1000 most vulnerable days use case covers:<< <br>
( ) From the time the child is born up until 3 years of age<br>
(x) From the time the child is conceived up until 2 years of age<br>
( ) From the time a mother receives antenatal care and completes her post-natal care</p>

<p>[explanation]<br>
The 1000 most vulnerable days covers both infant and mother from the time from when the child was conceived to the child&rsquo;s 2nd birthday. This is a critical time for child development; the right nutrition for the mother and for the child during this time can have a profound impact on the child's growth and development and reduce disease risk, as well as protect the mother's health. Elements linked to this use case are used throughout this academy.<br>
[explanation]</p>

<p>>>This use case is used to help us define: (select one or more)<< <br>
[x] The services that are provided to the mother and child<br>
[x] The data we collect in relation to those services<br>
[x] The outputs we create in relation to those services</p>

<p>[explanation]<br>
All 3 of these items are used to translate elements of the use-case (in this case, a health-related use case) over to DHIS 2. It is important to identify what the key inputs and outputs are; this is often best accomplished by understanding the use-case in detail. <br>
[explanation]</p>

<p>Mini Quiz (not graded) - Overview of DHIS2</p>

<p>====</p>

<p>>>We can collect different types of data directly within DHIS 2 (for example, aggregate data or anonymous individual-level data)<< <br>
(x) True<br>
( ) False</p>

<p>[explanation]<br>
DHIS 2 can collect different types of data directly within the application. This includes aggregate data, event data (anonymous, individual level data) and &ldquo;tracker&rdquo; data (identifiable, individual level data).<br>
[explanation]</p>

<p>>>We can configure data quality checks by creating user-defined validation rules which check the data that is entered<< <br>
(x) True<br>
( ) False</p>

<p>[explanation]<br>
Mathematical rules, referred to as validation rules, can be defined by a user in order to check the data that is being entered. This is one of electronic methods checking data quality in DHIS 2 and will be discussed further in other sessions.<br>
[explanation]</p>

<p>>>We can define the variables that we are collecting directly through the DHIS2 user-interface<< <br>
(x) True<br>
( ) False</p>

<p>[explanation]<br>
As mentioned in the demo, it is a key principle of DHIS 2 to allow the user to customize what they are collecting directly through the user-interface.<br>
[explanation]</p>

<p>>>The outputs we create can not be given additional descriptions/interpretations directly within DHIS 2<< <br>
( ) True<br>
(x) False</p>

<p>[explanation]<br>
We can provide all of our outputs with additional descriptions and discuss interpretations directly within DHIS 2. This allows us to give the item more context for when other users are reviewing the information and will be discussed further in the analysis sessions.<br>
[explanation]</p>

<p>>>The analyses/outputs that we create can not be shared with other users directly within DHIS 2<< <br>
( ) True<br>
(x) False</p>

<p>[explanation]<br>
The analyses/outputs that are created can be shared with other users directly within DHIS 2. This will be discussed more in later sessions.<br>
[explanation]</p>

<h2>NOTE: THIS IS A GRADED QUIZ.</h2>
<p>You are allowed&nbsp;3 attempts for this quiz.</p>
<p>There is 30 seconds of time between each attempt, so if you don't get it right, just breathe in, watch the videos once more and carefully read the question again.</p>

<p>>>Which of the following are the core dimensions of the Data Model in DHIS 2 (Select one or more)?<< <br>
    [x] Organization unit (Where)<br>
    [x] Data element (What)<br>
    [x] Period (When)<br>
    [ ]None of the above</p>
    
    <p>[explanation]<br>
    As highlighted in the core concepts presentation, there are 3 core dimensions in DHIS2.<br>
    Organization units refers to the geographical location or where aspect Data Elements refers to what we are collecting Periods refers to when we are collecting that information.<br>
    [explanation]</p>
    
    <p>>>Organisation Units represent (select one):<< <br>
    [x] The geographical location of the data<br>
    [ ] Calculated data values<br>
    [ ] Health program projects</p>
    
    <p>[explanation]<br>
    In the core concepts presentation, organization units are referred to as the geographical location of the data<br>
    [explanation]</p>
    
    <p>
    In DHIS2, data elements and indicators represent the same concept.<br>
    [ ] True<br>
    [x] False</p>
    
    <p>[explanation]<br>
    In the building blocks presentation, it is noted that data elements and indicators represent different concepts. Data elements are the raw data, while indicators are calculated values.<br>
    [explanation]</p>
    
    <p>
    Which of the following are data elements (select one or more)?<br>
    [x] Number of maternal deaths<br>
    [ ] Maternal Mortality Ratio (per 100,000)<br>
    [x] Number of positive malaria cases<br>
    [ ] Annual Malaria Parasite Incidence</p>
    
    <p>[explanation]<br>
    The data elements are the raw data values that we collect. Calculated values such as ratios and incidences are considered indicators.<br>
